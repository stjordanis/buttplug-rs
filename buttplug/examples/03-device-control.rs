                // see what types of messages whatever device handed to us can
                // take, and then react accordingly.

                //
                // - Message Attributes, which can vary depending on the type
                // of message
                //
                // For instance the VibrateCmd message will have a name of
                // "VibrateCmd", and a "FeatureCount" of 1 < x < N, depending on
                // the number of vibration motors the device has. Messages that
                // don't have a FeatureCount will leave Option<FeatureCount> as
                // None.
                //
                // Since we don't know what kind of device we'll be getting

                // Devices have "generic" commands for vibrate, rotate, and
                // linear (movement). Each of these takes a enum that is either:
                //
                // - A single value to send to all features. For instance if a
                // device has 6 vibrators, and we send one speed, all 6
                // vibrators will be set to that speed.
                //
                // - A map of index/value pairs, which allows setting certain
                // device feature indexes to certain values.
                //
                // - A vector of values, which can address most or all feature
                // indexes.
                //
