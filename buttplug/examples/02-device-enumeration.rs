    // Since we don't have a server implementation yet, I'll be skipping the
    // explanation of how Device Subtype Managers work for this.

    // Let's talk about when and how you'll get events (in this case,
    // DeviceAdded events) from the server.
    //
    // The server can fire device connection events at 2 points.
    //
    // - When a client first connects, if the server has a device connection it
    // is already holding.
    //
    // - During device scanning.
    //
    // When the client connects as part of ButtplugClient::run(), it asks the
    // server for a list of already connected devices. The server will return
    // these as DeviceAdded events, including a ButtplugDevice instance we can
    // then use to control the device.
    //
    // A quick aside on why a server could hold devices. There are a few reasons
    // this could happen, some chosen, some forced.
    //
    // - On Windows 10, it is sometimes difficult to get bluetooth LE devices to
    // disconnect, so some software (including the Windows Buttplug Server)
    // leaves devices connected until either the device is powered off/taken out
    // of bluetooth range, or the program terminates.
    //
    // - Depending on how a server is being used, parts of it like a device
    // manager may stay alive between client connections. This would mean that
    // if a client disconnected from a server then reconnected quickly, setup
    // steps wouldn't have to happen again.
    //
    // With that out of the way, let's build our client.
    let app_closure = |mut client: ButtplugClient| {
        async move {
            // First, we'll start the server looking for devices.
            if let Err(err) = client.start_scanning().await {
                // If the server disconnected between the time we spun up the
                // loop and now, the scanning will return an error. At that
                // point we should just bail out.
                println!("Client errored when starting scan! {}", err);
                return;
            }
            // Ok, we've started scanning. Now we need to wait to hear back from
            // the server on whether we got anything. To do that, we call
            // wait_for_event.
            //
            // wait_for_event is to Buttplug's Rust implementation what the
            // event handlers in C#/JS were to those implementations. However,
            // since we're not in a GC'd language anymore, event handlers are a
            // bit difficult to implement, so we just have a stream-like
            // function instead.
            //
            // wait_for_event will return a future that waits until it gets
            // something from the server. You can either await that and block
            // until you get something from the server (or race/select it
            // against other futures), or else save the future and use something
            // like a timeout join.
            //
            // For our purposes for the moment, all we care about is receiving
            // new devices, so we'll just loop and wait.
